                <h2> HeavyWater and SimplexWater: LLM Watermarking</h2>
                <br>How can we distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text? One effective approach is through watermarking LLM outputs. Watermarking works by subtly altering the model’s next-token predictions in a way that remains imperceptible to users but can be detected by a verifier who holds a secret key. We frame this watermarking process as an optimization problem: finding the "optimal perturbation" to the token distribution according to a fixed score function that is accessible only with the secret key. For binary score functions, this reduces to a classic distance-maximizing code design problem in coding theory, followed by an optimal transport problem. We also extend the analysis to non-binary scores and derive a new watermarking scheme that outperforms existing watermarks, which is based on scores drawn from heavy-tailed distributions. The main contributions of this work are:  <ul>
                    <li>Providing a generalized information-theoretic framework for analyzing watermakrs, which includes many of the existing watermarks as special cases</li>
                    <li> Providing the optimal watermark with binary scores (SimplexWater) that maximizes detection with zero distortion 
                    <li>Establishing conditions under which a watermark based on arbitrary scores maximizes detection, and introducing the HeavyWater watermark, which outperforms all existing approaches.</li>

                <h2> CorDP-DME: Correlated Privacy Mechanisms for Differentially Private Distributed Mean Estimation</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Differentially private distributed mean estimation (DP-DME) is a key component in private federated learning. DP-DME (with \(n\) distributed users) traditionally employs either local DP (LDP) or central DP (CDP), achieving MSEs of \(O(1/n)\) and \(O(1/n^2)\), respectively. CDP attains a lower MSE by relying on a trusted party. Cryptographic protocols such as <em>secure aggregation</em> have been integrated into DP-DME systems to achieve CDP-level MSE without a trusted party. 
                    However, they result in multiple-round protocols and involve significant communication and computational overhead. We propose CorDP-DME, an alternative DP-DME mechanism that is based on an information-theoretic framework that uses optimally correlated Gaussian noise, and effectively navigates the trade-off between privacy, accuracy and robustness, bridging the gap between LDP and CDP error bounds. CorDP-DME:
                    <ul>
                    <li>is a single-round protocol</li>
                    <li> requires no trusted party</li>
                    <li> achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to LDP</li>
                    <li> incurs substantially lower communication and computational costs and increased resilience against dropouts and colluding users compared to secure aggregation.</li>

                <h2> Multi-Group Proportional Representation in Database Retrieval and Text-to-Image Generation</h2>
                <br>
                <p> In image retrieval and text-to-image generation, ensuring well-represented results for user queries is essential to avoid representational harms—instances where certain groups, individuals, or traits are misrepresented or excluded due to biases in data or model behavior. These biases can perpetuate stereotypes, result in unfair outcomes, and marginalize underrepresented communities.
                    While prior research has explored fairness by enforcing equal or proportional representation across individual attributes such as race or gender, less attention has been given to intersectional groups, which are defined by combinations of multiple attributes (e.g., race and gender together).
                    Our work addresses this gap by developing tools to measure and mitigate representational harms in both image retrieval and text-to-image generation. Specifically, we:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduce Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a theoretically grounded metric for measuring intersectional group representation</li>
                        <li> Propose Multi-Group Aware Proportional Retrieval (MAPR), an image retrieval algorithm that improves both fairness and accuracy, outperforming existing fair retrieval approaches</li>
                        <li> Conduct a comprehensive analysis of representational gaps in current text-to-image generation models, and propose a method to mitigate these disparities.</li>

                <h2> Private Applroximate Nearest neighbor Search for Vector Database Querying</h2>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Vector databases have become increasingly popular in ML/AI applications such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and recommendation systems. They store high-dimensional embeddings of text, images, or video data and enable efficient retrieval by converting user queries into vector embeddings and ranking results based on similarity.
                    Given the scale—often millions of entries—they rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search techniques for fast retrieval.
                    In this work, we propose a novel method for performing ANN search while ensuring perfect privacy of user queries, effectively extending the classical notion of private information retrieval to the setting of vector databases.
                    We introduce an information-theoretic formulation of the private ANN problem and present a scheme based on Reed-Solomon codes that guarantees perfect privacy without sacrificing the accuracy of the underlying non-private ANN algorithm.
                    Our approach achieves lower communication costs compared to existing cryptographic protocols for private ANN search.</p>

                <h2> PRUW: <i>Private Read-Update-Write</i> for Efficient Federated Learning with Perfect Information-theoretic Privacy</h2>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Private-Read-Update-Write (PRUW) is an information-theoretic framework that enables users to privately download (read) and update (write) sections of a data storage system without revealing the values of the updates or the sections accessed, while ensuring perfect accuracy. PRUW has applications in efficient variants of federated learning (FL) such as federated submodel learning (FSL) and FL with gradient sparsification. In FSL, the users only download and update sections of the model that can be updated by their limited data types, which reduces communication and computation costs; however, the accessed sections and update values can still disclose users' private information. Similarly, in FL with sparsification, users transmit only the most significant \(r\) fraction of updates, with the indices and values potentially revealing sensitive information. PRUW addresses these concerns by using coding theoretic tools that perfectly hides the values and the indices of the downloaded and updated information while maintaining perfect accuracy.
                    We propose two variants: 
                    <ul>
                        <li> structured PRUW, where the FL model is divided into pre-determined sections (as in FSL)
                        <li> unstructured PRUW, where the selected content has no specific structure (as in the top \(r\) updates selected in gradient sparsification).
                    </ul>
                    For both, We develop coding schemes using the properties of Lagrange polynomials and Cauchy-Vandermonde matrices, along with concepts from <it>coded computing</it> and <it>private information retrieval (PIR)</it> to achieve perfect privacy and accuracy. We show that the asymptotic communication cost of PRUW can be as low as twice that of the corresponding non-private read-write operations. 
                    Additionally, we provide the following extensions of basic PRUW:   
                    <ul>
                        <li> Relaxing the perfect privacy and accuracy conditions in PRUW to characterize the rate-distortion and rate-privacy-storage trade-offs with corresponding achievable schemes.
                        <li> PRUW schemes that are applicable to servers with arbitrary storage constraints.
                             </ul>

                <p> 
                    Private information retrieval (PIR) has been widely studied in information theory to obtain the fundamental communication rates in perfectly private database retrieval. In PIR, a user downloads a required file from a database system that stores multiple files, without revealing what was downloaded.
                    We introduced and analyzed the following variants of PIR:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Semantic PIR, which broadens the scope of classical PIR by incorporating files with arbitrary lengths and retrieval probabilities. By deriving the capacity of semantic PIR, we demonstrated that semantic PIR always outperforms classical PIR. Our findings highlight the benefits of leveraging the natural differences in files to improve the communication rate, as opposed to adhering strictly to the classical PIR model.
                            <li> Quantum PIR, which considers quantum communication channels instead of classical channels in PIR to improve the communication rates by a factor of two.

                <h1> My Story</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Sri Lanka, a beautiful island often called the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean." My love for math and science began at a young age and eventually led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering at the University of Peradeniya. 
                    During my time there, I discovered a passion for aerodynamics, particularly through my final-year research project on wind loads on tall buildings, guided by Prof. Kushan Wijesundara. Inspired by binge-watching Mayday: Air Crash Investigations, I developed a deep interest in aeronautics and decided to pursue higher studies in the United States.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2018, I joined the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Research Lab at the University of Maryland, where I was fortunate to work under the mentorship of Prof. James Baeder. 
                    After completing my PhD in 2023, I began my professional journey with Maglev Aero, a cutting-edge company developing electric propulsion systems powered by magnetic levitation.
                    <br><br></ber>
                    During my years in Maryland, I also embraced photography, capturing memories as I explored much of the U.S. with friends. Here are some of the pictures from those travels—each one holds a cherished memory that I will treasure forever.
